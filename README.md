# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection Using Logistic Regression This project focuses on detecting fake news articles by leveraging a classic machine learning algorithm: Logistic Regression. The model outputs a prediction label along with the probability of the news being fake or real.

üì∞ Fake News Prediction ‚Äî Project Description
This project aims to accurately detect fake news articles using machine learning techniques. With the rise of misinformation on social media and online platforms, automated detection systems have become essential in promoting truthful information.

In this project, we built a Fake News Detection model using Logistic Regression, a robust and interpretable algorithm for binary classification. The model was trained on a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98% on the test data.

üîç How It Works
üßπ Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized news text data.

‚úçÔ∏è Vectorization: Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF.

üß† Model: Trained a Logistic Regression classifier on the vectorized data.

‚úÖ Prediction: The app predicts whether the input news text is real or fake.

‚úÖ Key Features
1)High accuracy: 98%
2)Simple and fast: Uses Logistic Regression
3)Web-based interface built with Streamlit
4)Real-time news classification
